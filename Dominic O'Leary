However, you can also take advantage of swift's type inference, and use the Double version of the init, to simplify the frame creation a little.  e.g.:
let rect = CGRect(x: 100, y: 400, width: 200, height: 100)
Also, for the addSubView(rectView) call, you do not need "self." in front of it in current versions of swift
